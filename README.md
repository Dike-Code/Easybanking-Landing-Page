## Overview

A Easy Bank Landing Page Solution from the Challange presented by Frontend Mentor... it's built with a pure HTML5 for laying out the structure, CSS for styling the website to make it more compelling, responsive and user friendly... A little bit of Javascript was also utilized in order to make the site more interactive.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

I learnt all whole lot.

```html
<section class="hero">
   <div class="hero__container">
      <div class="hero__img">
         <img
            src="./images/image-mockups.png"
            class="hero__img"
            alt="hero image"
         />
      </div>
   </div>
</section>
```

```css
.hero {
   position: relative;
   background-color: var(--Very-Light-Gray);
   background-position: 500px 50%;
   background-repeat: no-repeat;
   height: 500px;
   overflow: visible;
   z-index: -1;
}

.hero .hero__container {
   max-width: 90%;
   height: 100%;
   padding: 0 20px;
   margin: 0 auto;
   display: flex;
   align-items: center;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
   console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

All, Practice... Practice and Practice.

### Useful resources

-  [Traversy Media](https://www.example.com) - This helped me with the full asimillation of CSS FLEX BOX and Grid. I really liked this pattern Brad uses in explaining all the concepts one needs to master this craft.

-  [Youtube](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing website/platform which helped me finally understand a lot including the snippets on buiding a dropdown list. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
